DBMS:-

1. DBMS is used in business mainly for 3 reasons-> Persistency, Inter-Related and Shareable.It is a collection of tools that is used for creation and maintenance of databases.

2. SQL is used to communicate with a database and is a standard language for relational database management systems. It is a structured and Non-procedural(Not forced to write programming logic, instead single SELECT or any other statements gets the job done) language.

3.Data Warehouse is a logically centralized local repository where data from operational databases and other sources are integrated, cleaned and standardized to support Business Intelligence.

4. Set operators are used on the columns of both the tables as a whole, whereas the joins are applied on selected columns from both the tables.

5. In ERD's, we draw a solid line if and only if we have an ID-dependent relationship; otherwise it would be a dashed line.

6. If there is a functional dependency from x -> y, then we can search for y using the value of x, but not compute the value of y using x. So there cannot be different values for y , for a single value of x.
