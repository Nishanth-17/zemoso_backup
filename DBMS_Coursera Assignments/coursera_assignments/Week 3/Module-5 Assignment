1. For event requests, list the event number, event date (eventrequest.dateheld), and count of the event plans.  Only include event requests in the result if the event request has more than one related event plan with a work date in December 2018.

select EventRequest.evntNo, DateHeld, count(*) from 
EventRequest INNER JOIN EventPlan ON EventRequest.evntNo = EventPlan.eventno 
where workdate between '2018-12-01' and '2018-12-31' 
group by EventPlan.evntNo,DateHeld having count(*) > 1;

2. List the plan number, event number, work date, and activity of event plans meeting the following two conditions: (1) the work date is in December 2018 and (2) the event is held in the “Basketball arena”.  Your query must not use the facility number (“F101”) of the basketball arena in the WHERE clause. Instead, you should use a condition on the FacName column for the value of “Basketball arena”.

select planNo, evntNo, workdate, activity from 
EventPlan where(workdate between '2018-12-01' and '2018-12-31') 
and (eventno in (select eventno from EventRequest where facno in 
(select facno from Facility where facname = 'Basketball arena' )));


3. List the event number, event date, status, and estimated cost of events where there is an event plan managed by Mary Manager and the event is held in the basketball arena in the period October 1 to December 31, 2018.  Your query must not use the facility number (“F101”) of the basketball arena or the employee number (“E101”) of “Mary Manager” in the WHERE clause. Thus, the WHERE clause should not have conditions involving the facility number or employee number compared to constant values.

select EventRequest.eventno, dateheld, status, estcost from
EventRequest,EventPlan,Employee,Facility where 
EventRequest.eventno = EventPlan.eventno and EventPlan.empno = Employee.empno and
EventRequest.facno = Facility.facno and dateheld between '2018-10-01' and '2018-12-31' and
empname = 'Mary Manager' and facname = 'Basketball arena';

Database Modification:- 

1. Insert a new row into the Facility table with facility name “Swimming Pool”.

insert into Facility values ('F200' , 'Swimming Pool');

2. Change the location name of “Door” to “Gate” for the row inserted in modification problem 2.

update Location set locname = 'Gate' where locno = 'L200';

3. Delete the row inserted in modification problem 3.

delete from Location where locno = 'L201';
